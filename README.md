- 👋 Hi, I’m @LionOte6176 also known as the guy with the (modified) default template.
- 👀 I’m interested in using the Godot engine to create my own games.
- 🌱 I know some GDScript, but I'm interested in learning the C trio - C, C#, and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own stuff.
- 📫 There isn't currently a way to reach me directly.
